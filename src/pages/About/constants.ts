    p1: `We were working together as a group on a project for seven weaks. We created a project task board using a
        project management tool Trello to organize tasks into lists or columns corresponding to their status.`,
    p2: `Our team effectively collaborated on the e-commerce store project by 
          maintaining open and constant communication through stand-up meetings. 
          Each member was assigned clear responsibilities, allowing for efficient task 
          management and accountability. We utilized tools like Trello, Diskord and 
          Telegram to track progress and address any issues in real-time. By 
          leveraging each member's expertise and bringing up a supportive 
          environment, we successfully developed a functional and user-friendly online plant store.`,
