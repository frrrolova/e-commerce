        project management tool Trello to organize tasks into lists or columns corresponding to their status.`,
    p2: `We started each sprint with sprint planning, where we break down project tasks into smaller, manageable
        subtasks and assign them to each other, ensuring a clear delegation of responsibilities. During the
        sprint, we met for dailies, where each team member shared the status of their tasks. We shared workloads
        while discussing ideas, new methods, or different perspectives to attain better solutions. We actively
        participated in code reviews, providing constructive feedback and suggestions to our peers. At the end of
        the sprint we summed up the results and planned further work.`,
